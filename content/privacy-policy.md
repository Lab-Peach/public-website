If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email , the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.

### 3.3 When you create an offer

To be able to make use of Peach you will enter information relating to the trades you would like to do in the form of an offer. The information you will provide is divided in three groups (see also 4.2):

1. #### Publically available information

    * the payment method(s) you want to use
    * the currencies you want to use

    * chat messages

3. #### Information available to Peach

    * the bitcoin address you want to receive the bitcoin on

### 3.4 Optionally shared data

#### Usage data

You have the possibility to help Peach optimalize the user experience in P2P-trading by automatically sending usage data. The data is collected in Google Firebase & Google Analytics.

You can toggle sharing usage data on/off in Settings > About Peach > Diagnostics

#### Crash reports

When the Peach app detects that the app has run into an unexpected issue, a crash report is generated.

You will be prompted to decide whether or not you would like to share this crash report to the Peach team. The Peach team can use this crash report to find the root cause and improve the software to avoid this problem occurring in the future.

The crash reports are collected in Google Firebase.

## How and why we use and/or share your information

### 4.1 Lawful basis for processing your information

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

* when you asked us to do so, or provided consent for us to do so
* when we need to do so in order to resolve a dispute
* when we need to do so to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation

You will receive marketing messages from us if you have given us your consent to do so by signing up on the website.

To unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time, you can click the unsubscribe link that can be found at the bottom of any marketing email. You may also [contact us]($contactEmail$) to inform us if you do not wish to receive any marketing materials from us.

### 4.2 Sharing your information

We share your information with the following parties:

* #### The public

    Some of your information is publically available to anyone with a Peach account while making use of our matchmaking service. See section 3.3 for more information.

* #### Your counterparty

    People you trade with will need extra information to be able to conclude the trade you want to perform between the 2 of you. Only the information relevant to the trade you double match with will be provided to the counterparty.

    Peach User data passes through the Peach server encrypted. This includes:

  * your payment details
  * the chat between you and your trading partner

* #### Service providers

    We do not sell your information, and never will. We only share your data with third parties to help use, provide and improve our Services. We strictly limit how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. We share your data with the following parties:

  * **ProtonMail**: For our email communications we use "ProtonMail". We may share your email and nickname with this service.
  * **Zammad**: For customer support we use "Zammad". We may share your email address with this service.
  * **MailerLite**: For marketing emails and registering early access users, we use "MailerLite". We may share your email address with this service.
  * **Firebase** (opt-in): To monitor for and fix crashes, we give you the option to send a crash report after a crash. In case you choose to send this report, we use the "Firebase" service to collect and analyze the crash logs. Your IP address may be included in the error messages.
  * **Firebase & Google Analytics** (opt-in): When you allow Peach to send usage data, we use "Firebase" & "Google Analytics" service to collect the data we use in behavioral statistics. Your IP address may be included in the data we provide to Firebase, which is used by Firebase to understand how you use our Service.

### 4.3 Disputes

When a dispute is opened, the party that opened the dispute will share their digital signature with Peach, allowing the mediator to decrypt the communication between the Buyer and the Seller. Peach gains access to your conversation and all other information required, including the payment details for the disputed contract by Peach to resolve the dispute for as long as the Dispute takes.

You will also be obliged to provide us with any proof to support your dispute claim such as account statements, payment details, ID etc. relative to the disputed trade. Any information which may be required for dispute resolution will be documented in the dispute.

Once a dispute is logged, a hash of the IP and other data will temporarily be stored for as long as the dispute is open. When an arbitrator regards the behavior of one of both parties as an attempt to defraud the counterparty, or as showing unwanted behavior, the dispute might result in a ban for the offending user. To this end a hash of the device ID and payment method data will be stored, in order to avoid the possibility of the banned user to create another account. This hash is a reference to the data, but not the data itself. It allows the system to flag users using the same data, without knowing the actual data itself.

## 5. Security

To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed or disclosed.

Communication between the Peach App and the Peach server uses SSL encryption.

## 6. Contact

If you have any questions, comments, concerns or other correspondence, or if you think that we haven't followed this privacy policy, we can be contacted via email on [gdpr@peachbitcoin.com](mailto:gdpr@peachbitcoin.com)
