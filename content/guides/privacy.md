# Privacy Guide

## What info does Peach collect of me?

We strive to store the absolute minimum amount of data on our users as we can. As a quick overview, this is what we have on our servers:

- A hash\* of your phone's ID
- A hash of your payment data
- Your encrypted chats
- The data of your trades (which type of payment method you're using, how much you're buying, etc.)
- Usage data, if you agreed to this

For a full breakdown, please see our privacy policy.

\* A hash is some data that was made unrecognizable, similar to encrypting it. The same data will always lead to the same hash. This means we don't know what the data is, but we will be able to spot if the same data is used twice.

## What info is sent when I share usage data?

## Who can see my payment details?

Only your counterparty can see your payment details; they are sent via the Peach servers, but are fully end to end encrypted (like with most chat apps) so that we cannot see what they are.

When you start a dispute, you and your counterparty's payment details and your chat history will be visible to the assigned Peach mediator.
