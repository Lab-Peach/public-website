# For meetups

Peach app includes a feature which almost no one else is offering right now: *Bitcoin Cash Trades.*

The problems of cash trades are obvious for everyone who has ever tried to do one of them, such as the security of doing this kind of trades, the risk of RBF, and doxxing your telegram/twitter username to find other peers to trade with.

Peach aims to solve this issue by *partnering with meetups all over the world* to facilitate safe & secure places to trade Bitcoin with cash. That's why we are getting in touch with the meetup organizers from all around to let them know everything we need from their part to integrate their meetup into our app.

If you are a meetup organizer and would like to get your meetup into Peach, fill the contact form below and we'll get back to you to proceed with the integration!
