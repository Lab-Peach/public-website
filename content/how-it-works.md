### Peach Bitcoin wallet: Self-custodial

**Not your keys, not your coins.**

Peach offers a self-custodial wallet inside the app, with your own mnemonic and the possibility to connect it to your own node.

However, if you prefer to keep using another wallet, you also have the option to disable the peach wallet and use the app just as a p2p exchange, sending the coins to your preferred wallet.

### Your account lives on your phone, not in our server

Your private data (payment details, chat messages) are stored encrypted on your phone.
Make sure to create a backup of your account!

### Reputation system

Each account has a reputation score that allows to reward good actors and to punish malicious ones.
Your number of trades and the speed at
which you trade will get you special badges recognitions!

### Multi-signatures escrow

We set up a 2 out 2 multi-signatures escrow with the seller to ensure to the buyer that the sats exist.
If the seller is malicious, Peach will be able to send the sats to the buyer after 30 days without the signature of the seller.

### Customer support service

Peach will help you throughout the buying or selling process and will also be here to mitigate disputes directly from the chat inside the app.

## Peach Matches

### How does Peach Matchmaking work?

Peach connects you with another Bitcoin Buyer or Seller according to your preferences of currencies and payment methods.
Based on this, Peach notifies you when you receive matching offers. We sort the matches by reputation score and price of the offer.

### How is a trade created?

A Buyer can match as many sell offers as he wants.
The first Seller to accept the Buyer's offer (Double Match) gets the trade!

### Can I un-match an offer?

At any time! Watch out, your reputation score will be slightly be affected for unmatching an offer.

### Can I cancel a Double Match (a trade)?

A trade is created as soon as the Seller accepts a Buyer's offer.
The Buyer automatically receives the Seller's payment details*.
The Buyer can cancel the trade at anytime.
The Seller can only cancel a trade by asking first to the Buyer if he is okay to cancel.
Watch out, cancelling a trade impacts your reputation score.

### Why does the Buyer matches and the Seller double matches?

In Peach, the Seller sets the price at which they wants to sell their sats.
The Buyer shows his interest for an offer by matching it and the Seller chooses to trade with the best match offer he receives.
If Buyers don't receive double matches, they are incentivised to match more offers.
If Sellers don't receive matches, they are incentivised to adjust their price and increase their reputation score.

## How Peach works

### Is Peach free?

Peach can be downloaded for free in the App Store (Testflight) and Google Play Store.
Buyers and sellers can publish their offers for free.
Buyers pay 2% of transaction fee to Peach for every trade completed.
Sellers do not pay any fee.

### What's the difference between Peach and regular Bitcoin exchanges?

Peach is not buying or selling Bitcoin from/to its users.
Our mission is to facilitate the connection between peers and provide the safest infrastructure possible to trade peer-to-peer.
Buying or selling from another peer allows you to send or receive a payment from/to a non-related Bitcoin company and to use the payment of method of your choice.
Last but not least, the user owns his Bitcoin.

### Is it safe to buy and sell Bitcoin on Peach?

We work hard to ensure a safe marketplace free of malicious actors.
We implement a series of actions to identify bad actors and keep them away from the platform.
Peach remains a public space available to everyone, so as per the nature of public spaces, some outliers can access the free marketplace.

### When is the price of the trade set?

When the buyer matches an offer.
The seller may accept this match or not.

### Where can I use Peach?

Peach supports currencies from the European zone at the moment.
We aim to make Peach available in as many countries as possible, as soon as possible.

### Can Peach be used on laptop?

Peach is native mobile application and only available to download for free in the App Store and Google Play Stored.

### How does the Peach reputation score work?
